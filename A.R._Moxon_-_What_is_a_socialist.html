      <h1>A.R. Moxon - What is a socialist?</h1>
<p>This is an excerpt from an excerpt of an upcoming book:<br />
APAvar: Moxon, A.R. (2024).  Very Fine People.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A “socialist,” by the way, is somebody who thinks that society exists, and that governments should work for the health and thriving of human beings, and that this means that some things that are conducive to the public good are good in and of themselves even if they don’t create profit for industry, and therefore many such things—like education, or art, or the judicial process, or medical care, or transportation—should be public goods provided by and for the public, administered by representatives chosen by the public, rather than profit centers run specifically and exclusively to turn a profit. They also believe that profit engines should be regulated, to prevent them from making decisions that would maximize profits but also harm human beings. So that’s what a socialist is, and it’s one of the most horrible awful things a person can be, and if you don’t believe me, just go to the real world and ask one of the adults in the room about it.</p>
